### Problem Description

You are given an integer A. Determine whether A is a perfect number or not.

A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors. Proper divisors of a natural number are divisors that are strictly less than the number itself.

### Problem Constraints

1 <= A <= 10^6

### Input Format

The input consists of a single positive integer A.

### Output Format

Output 1 if A is a perfect number, and 0 otherwise.

### Example Input

Input 1:
A = 4

Input 2:
A = 6

### Example Output

Output 1:
0

Output 2:
1

### Example Explanation

Explanation 1:
For A = 4, the sum of its proper divisors (1 + 2 = 3) is not equal to 4.

Explanation 2:
For A = 6, the sum of its proper divisors (1 + 2 + 3 = 6) is equal to 6.
