## Problem Description

Given a positive integer A, the task is to find the square root of the number if it is a perfect square; otherwise, return -1.

### Problem Constraints

The input integer A lies within the range 1 to 10^8 (1 <= A <= 10^8).

### Input Format

The input consists of a single integer A.

### Output Format

Return an integer value that represents the square root of A if A is a perfect square. Otherwise, return -1.

### Example Input

Input 1:

```
A = 4
```

Input 2:

```
A = 1001
```

### Example Output

Output 1:

```
2
```

Output 2:

```
-1
```

### Example Explanation

Explanation 1:
